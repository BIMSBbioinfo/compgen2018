  abstract = "MOTIVATION: DNA methylation plays critical roles in gene
              regulation and cellular specification without altering DNA
              sequences. The wide application of reduced representation
              bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing
              (bis-seq) opens the door to study DNA methylation at single CpG
              site resolution. One challenging question is how best to test for
              significant methylation differences between groups of biological
              samples in order to minimize false positive findings. RESULTS: We
              present a statistical analysis package, methylSig, to analyse
              genome-wide methylation differences between samples from
              different treatments or disease groups. MethylSig takes into
              account both read coverage and biological variation by utilizing
              a beta-binomial approach across biological samples for a CpG site
              or region, and identifies relevant differences in CpG
              methylation. It can also incorporate local information to improve
              group methylation level and/or variance estimation for
              experiments with small sample size. A permutation study based on
              data from enhanced RRBS samples shows that methylSig maintains a
              well-calibrated type-I error when the number of samples is three
              or more per group. Our simulations show that methylSig has higher
              sensitivity compared with several alternative methods. The use of
              methylSig is illustrated with a comparison of different subtypes
              of acute leukemia and normal bone marrow samples. AVAILABILITY:

              By contrast, promoters for genes expressed preferentially at
              later stages are often CG poor and primarily employ DNA
              methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early

              method to primary human bone marrow specimens from patients with
              Acute Myelogeneous Leukemia (AML), we demonstrated that
              genetically distinct AML subtypes display diametrically opposed

  abstract = "Analysis of bisulfite sequencing data usually requires two tasks:
              to call methylated cytosines (mCs) in a sample, and to detect
              differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between paired samples.
              Although numerous tools have been proposed for mC calling,
              methods for DMR detection have been largely limited. Here, we
              present Bisulfighter, a new software package for detecting mCs
              and DMRs from bisulfite sequencing data. Bisulfighter combines
              the LAST alignment tool for mC calling, and a novel framework for
              DMR detection based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike
              previous attempts that depend on empirical parameters,
              Bisulfighter can use the expectation-maximization algorithm for
              HMMs to adjust parameters for each data set. We conduct extensive
              experiments in which accuracy of mC calling and DMR detection is

              qualities, sequencing depths and DMR lengths, as well as on real

              fewer false positives, more precise estimates of mC levels, more

              challenging, malignant childhood brain tumour, is no exception.
              Despite much progress from recent genomics studies, with
              recurrent changes identified in each of the four distinct tumour
              subgroups (WNT-pathway-activated, SHH-pathway-activated, and the
              less-well-characterized Group 3 and Group 4), many cases still

              augmented with matched whole-genome, RNA and chromatin

              between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome, and its effects
              on medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Most notable were highly
              prevalent regions of hypomethylation correlating with increased
              gene expression, extending tens of kilobases downstream of
              transcription start sites. Focal regions of low methylation
              linked to transcription-factor-binding sites shed light on
              differential transcriptional networks between subgroups, whereas
              increased methylation due to re-normalization of repressed
              chromatin in DNA methylation valleys was positively correlated
              with gene expression. Large, partially methylated domains
              affecting up to one-third of the genome showed increased mutation
              rates and gene silencing in a subgroup-specific fashion.
              Epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma
              candidate genes (for example, LIN28B), resulting in alternative
              promoter usage and/or differential messenger RNA/microRNA
              expression. Analysis of mouse medulloblastoma and precursor-cell

              high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) or ChIP followed by genome
              tiling array analysis (ChIP-chip) have become standard
              technologies for genome-wide identification of DNA-binding
              protein target sites. A number of algorithms have been developed
              in parallel that allow identification of binding sites from
              ChIP-seq or ChIP-chip datasets and subsequent visualization in
              the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser as
              custom annotation tracks. However, summarizing these tracks can
              be a daunting task, particularly if there are a large number of
              binding sites or the binding sites are distributed widely across
              the genome. RESULTS: We have developed ChIPpeakAnno as a
              Bioconductor package within the statistical programming
              environment R to facilitate batch annotation of enriched peaks
              identified from ChIP-seq, ChIP-chip, cap analysis of gene
              expression (CAGE) or any experiments resulting in a large number
              of enriched genomic regions. The binding sites annotated with
              ChIPpeakAnno can be viewed easily as a table, a pie chart or
              plotted in histogram form, i.e., the distribution of distances to
              the nearest genes for each set of peaks. In addition, we have
              implemented functionalities for determining the significance of
              overlap between replicates or binding sites among transcription
              factors within a complex, and for drawing Venn diagrams to
              visualize the extent of the overlap between replicates.
              Furthermore, the package includes functionalities to retrieve
              sequences flanking putative binding sites for PCR amplification,
              cloning, or motif discovery, and to identify Gene Ontology (GO)
              terms associated with adjacent genes. CONCLUSIONS: ChIPpeakAnno

              essential roles in cellular processes including gene regulation,
              development and disease and is widely dysregulated in most types
              of cancer. Recent advances in sequencing technology have enabled
              the measurement of DNA methylation at single nucleotide
              resolution through methods such as whole-genome bisulfite
              sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing. In
              DNA methylation studies, a key task is to identify differences
              under distinct biological contexts, for example, between tumor
              and normal tissue. A challenge in sequencing studies is that the
              number of biological replicates is often limited by the costs of
              sequencing. The small number of replicates leads to unstable
              variance estimation, which can reduce accuracy to detect

              lognormal-beta-binomial hierarchical model, which provides a
              basis for information sharing across different CpG sites. A Wald
              test is developed for hypothesis testing at each CpG site.
              Simulation results show that the proposed method yields improved
              DML detection compared to existing methods, particularly when the

              followed by high-throughput sequencing is increasingly being used
              to assess genome-wide methylation at single-base resolution. The
              relative slowness of most commonly used aligners for processing
              such data introduces an unnecessarily long delay between receipt
              of raw data and statistical analysis. While this process can be
              sped-up by using computer clusters, current tools are not
              designed with them in mind and end-users must create such
              implementations themselves. RESULTS: Here, we present a novel
              BS-seq aligner, Bison, which exploits multiple nodes of a
              computer cluster to speed up this process and also has increased
              accuracy. Bison is accompanied by a variety of helper programs

              control and preparing results for statistical analysis by a

              bison\_herd, a variant of Bison with the same output but that can

              5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) by the TET family proteins. Thymine DNA
              glycosylase can further remove 5fC and 5caC, connecting 5mC

              chemical modification-assisted bisulfite sequencing (CAB-Seq)

              optimized 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide
              hydrochloride (EDC)-catalyzed amide bond formation between the
              carboxyl group of 5caC and a primary amine group. We found that
              the modified 5caC can survive the bisulfite treatment without
              deamination. Therefore, this chemical labeling coupled with
              bisulfite treatment provides a base-resolution detection and

              hypomethylation in the transformed cell residing in gene-poor

              There are an increasing number of publicly available pipelines
              for analyzing WGBS data, reflecting many choices of read mapping
              algorithms as well as preprocessing and postprocessing methods.
              We simulated single-end and paired-end reads based on three

              combinations of three preprocessing, five postprocessing and five

              data with single-end data at the same sequencing depth for
              performance of read mapping and methylation level estimation.
              Bismark and LAST were the most robust mapping algorithms. We
              found that Mott trimming and quality filtering individually

              subsequently generated PCR products. In contrast to cytosine,
              5-methylcytosine does not react with bisulfite and can therefore

               Although prior experience of a stimulus can produce a feeling of
               familiarity, that feeling can also be aroused in the absence of
               prior experience if perceptual processing of the stimulus is
               fluent (e.g., B. W. Whittlesea et al, 1990). This suggests that
               feelings of familiarity arise through an unconscious inference
               about the source of processing fluency. The present experiments
               extend that conclusion. First, they show that a wide variety of
               feelings about the past are controlled by a fluency heuristic,
               including feelings about the meaning, pleasantness, duration,
               and recency of past events. Second, they demonstrate that the
               attribution process does not rely only on perceptual fluency,
               but can be influenced even more by the fluency of conceptual
               processing. Third, they show that although the fluency heuristic
               itself is simple, people's use of it is highly sophisticated and
               makes them robustly sensitive to the actual historical status of

              compromise between an extremely comprehensive study of a human
              sample population with an intermediate level of resolution of
              CpGs at the genomic level. We obtained a DNA methylation
              fingerprint of 1628 human samples in which we interrogated 1505
              CpG sites. The DNA methylation patterns revealed show this
              epigenetic mark to be critical in tissue-type definition and
              stemness, particularly around transcription start sites that are
              not within a CpG island. For disease, the generated DNA
              methylation fingerprints show that, during tumorigenesis, human
              cancer cells underwent a progressive gain of promoter CpG-island
              hypermethylation and a loss of CpG methylation in non-CpG-island
              promoters. Although transformed cells are those in which DNA
              methylation disruption is more obvious, we observed that other
              common human diseases, such as neurological and autoimmune
              disorders, had their own distinct DNA methylation profiles. Most
              importantly, we provide proof of principle that the DNA
              methylation fingerprints obtained might be useful for

              the tumor type origin of cancers of unknown primary origin

              diseases, and cancer. Aligning bisulfite short reads to a
              reference genome has been a challenging task. We compared five
              bisulfite short read mapping tools, BSMAP, Bismark, BS-Seeker,
              BiSS, and BRAT-BW, representing two classes of mapping algorithms

              efficiency (i.e., the percentage of reads that can be mapped to
              the genomes), usability, running time, and effects of changing
              default parameter settings using both real and simulated reads.
              We also investigated how preprocessing data might affect mapping
              efficiency. Conclusion. Among the five programs compared, in
              terms of mapping efficiency, Bismark performs the best on the
              real data, followed by BiSS, BSMAP, and finally BRAT-BW and

              bisulfite treated short reads. Data quality impacts a great deal
              mapping efficiency. Although increasing the number of mismatches
              allowed can increase mapping efficiency, it not only
              significantly slows down the program, but also runs the risk of
              having increased false positives. Therefore, users should

              this paradigm as they show partial methylation for large portions
              (20\%-40\%) of the genome. While in PMDs methylation levels are
              reduced on average, we found that at single CpG resolution, they
              show extensive variability along the genome outside of CpG
              islands and DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS). Methylation
              levels range from 0\% to 100\% in a roughly uniform fashion with
              only little similarity between neighboring CpGs. A comparison of

              DNA cytosine methylation. Bisulfite treatment followed by PCR
              amplification specifically converts unmethylated cytosines to
              thymine. Coupled with next generation sequencing technology, it
              is able to detect the methylation status of every cytosine in the
              genome. However, mapping high-throughput bisulfite reads to the
              reference genome remains a great challenge due to the increased
              searching space, reduced complexity of bisulfite sequence,
              asymmetric cytosine to thymine alignments, and multiple CpG

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We recently showed that enzymes of the TET family
              convert 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in DNA. 5-hmC is
              present at high levels in embryonic stem cells and Purkinje
              neurons. The methylation status of cytosines is typically
              assessed by reaction with sodium bisulfite followed by PCR
              amplification. Reaction with sodium bisulfite promotes cytosine
              deamination, whereas 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) reacts poorly with
              bisulfite and is resistant to deamination. Since 5-hmC reacts
              with bisulfite to yield cytosine 5-methylenesulfonate (CMS), we
              asked how DNA containing 5-hmC behaves in bisulfite sequencing.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used synthetic
              oligonucleotides with different distributions of cytosine as
              templates for generation of DNAs containing C, 5-mC and 5-hmC.
              The resulting DNAs were subjected in parallel to bisulfite
              treatment, followed by exposure to conditions promoting cytosine
              deamination. The extent of conversion of 5-hmC to CMS was
              estimated to be 99.7\%. Sequencing of PCR products showed that
              neither 5-mC nor 5-hmC undergo C-to-T transitions after bisulfite
              treatment, confirming that these two modified cytosine species
              are indistinguishable by the bisulfite technique. DNA in which
              CMS constituted a large fraction of all bases (28/201) was much
              less efficiently amplified than DNA in which those bases were
              5-mC or uracil (the latter produced by cytosine deamination).
              Using a series of primer extension experiments, we traced the
              inefficient amplification of CMS-containing DNA to stalling of
              Taq polymerase at sites of CMS modification, especially when two
              CMS bases were either adjacent to one another or separated by 1-2
              nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that the widely used
              bisulfite sequencing technique does not distinguish between 5-mC
              and 5-hmC. Moreover, we show that CMS, the product of bisulfite
              conversion of 5-hmC, tends to stall DNA polymerases during PCR,
              suggesting that densely hydroxymethylated regions of DNA may be
              underrepresented in quantitative methylation analyses.",

              Here we show that our bimodal distribution model and weighted
              cost function for optimized regional methylation analysis
              provides accurate boundaries of regions harboring significant
              epigenetic modifications. Our algorithm takes the spatial
              distribution of CpGs into account for the enrichment assay,
              allowing for optimization of the definition of empirical regions
              for differential methylation. Combined with the dependent
              adjustment for regional p-value combination and DMR annotation,
              we provide a method that may be applied to a variety of datasets
              for rapid DMR analysis. Our method classifies both the
              directionality of DMRs and their genome-wide distribution, and we
              have observed that shows clinical relevance through correct
              stratification of two Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) tumor
              sub-types. CONCLUSIONS: Our weighted optimization algorithm eDMR
              for calling DMRs extends an established DMR R pipeline
              (methylKit) and provides a needed resource in epigenomics. Our
              method enables an accurate and scalable way of finding DMRs in
              high-throughput methylation sequencing experiments. eDMR is

              histone methylation and other chromatin modifications in mammals
              remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis of
              genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution in
              mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation
              bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we
              generated DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a
              representative sampling of conserved non-coding elements,
              transposons and other genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem
              cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived and primary neural cells, and
              eight other primary tissues. Several key findings emerge from the

              histone methylation patterns than with the underlying genome

              epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during cellular
              differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside of

              a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo
              aberrant hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro,
              in a pattern reminiscent of that reported in some primary

              the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma
              has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential
              expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data.
              The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading,
              normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities
              of limma have been significantly expanded in two important
              directions. First, the package can now perform both differential
              expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing
              (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously
              restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as
              well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and
              microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package
              is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression
              analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in
              terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order

              A total of 294,631 sequences was generated with an average read

              microarray platforms widely used in biological and medical
              research. Several recent studies highlighted the potentially
              confounding impact of the genomic variation on the results of
              methylation studies performed using Illumina's Infinium
              methylation probes. However, the complexity of SNPs impact on the
              methylation level measurements ($\beta$ values) has not been
              comprehensively described. RESULTS: In our comparative study of
              European and Asian populations performed using Illumina HM450K,
              we found that the majority of Infinium probes, which
              differentiated two examined groups, had SNPs in their target
              sequence. Characteristic tri-modal or bi-modal patterns of
              $\beta$ values distribution among individual samples were
              observed for CpGs with SNPs in the first and second position,
              respectively. To better understand how SNPs affect methylation
              readouts, we investigated their impact in the context of SNP
              position and type, and of the Illumina probe type (Infinium I or
              II). CONCLUSIONS: Our study clearly demonstrates that SNP
              variation existing in the genome, if not accounted for, may lead
              to false interpretation of the methylation signal differences
              suggested by some of the Illumina Infinium probes. In addition,
              it provides important practical clues for discriminating between
              differences due to the methylation status and to the genomic
              polymorphisms, based on the inspection of methylation readouts in
              individual samples. This approach is of special importance when

              such as the detection of copy number variations (CNVs), remain
              challenging. Current methods detect CNVs as changes in the depth
              of coverage along chromosomes. Technological or genomic
              variations in the depth of coverage thus lead to a high false
              discovery rate (FDR), even upon correction for GC content. In the
              context of association studies between CNVs and disease, a high
              FDR means many false CNVs, thereby decreasing the discovery power
              of the study after correction for multiple testing. We propose
              'Copy Number estimation by a Mixture Of PoissonS' (cn.MOPS), a
              data processing pipeline for CNV detection in NGS data. In
              contrast to previous approaches, cn.MOPS incorporates modeling of
              depths of coverage across samples at each genomic position.
              Therefore, cn.MOPS is not affected by read count variations along
              chromosomes. Using a Bayesian approach, cn.MOPS decomposes
              variations in the depth of coverage across samples into integer
              copy numbers and noise by means of its mixture components and
              Poisson distributions, respectively. The noise estimate allows
              for reducing the FDR by filtering out detections having high
              noise that are likely to be false detections. We compared cn.MOPS
              with the five most popular methods for CNV detection in NGS data
              using four benchmark datasets: (i) simulated data, (ii) NGS data
              from a male HapMap individual with implanted CNVs from the X
              chromosome, (iii) data from HapMap individuals with known CNVs,

              and recall for both gains and losses in all benchmark data sets.

              5-methylcytosine to thymine, and failure to convert unmethylated

              biological samples is an important task in bisulfite-seq data
              analysis. Several studies have attempted de novo finding of
              differentially methylated regions (DMRs) using hidden Markov
              models (HMMs). However, there is room for improvement in the
              design of HMMs, especially on emission functions that evaluate
              the likelihood of differential methylation at each cytosine site.
              RESULTS: We describe a new HMM for DMR detection from
              bisulfite-seq data. Our method utilizes emission functions that
              combine binomial models for aligned read counts, and beta
              mixtures for incorporating genome-wide methylation level
              distributions. We also develop unsupervised learning algorithms
              to adjust parameters of the beta-binomial models depending on
              differential methylation types (up, down, and not changed). In
              experiments on both simulated and real datasets, the new HMM
              improves DMR detection accuracy compared with HMMs in our

              The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG
              sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed
              non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the
              exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated
              to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the
              basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances
              outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on
              the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with
              fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly
              hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly

              exception of BatMeth, all mappers covered >70\% of CpG sites

              methylation (r(2) $\geq$ 0.95). Fourfold variation in mapping
              time was found between BSMAP (fastest) and Pash (slowest). In
              each library, 8-12\% of genomic regions covered by Bismark and

              shown to interact physically with a silencer region in Igf2,

              this chromatin loop and whether it restricts the physical access
              of distal enhancers to Igf2 is not known. We performed systematic
              chromosome conformation capture analyses in the Igf2/H19 region
              over >160 kb, identifying sequences that interact physically with
              the distal enhancers and the ICR. We found that, on the paternal
              chromosome, enhancers interact with the Igf2 promoters but that,
              on the maternal allele, this is prevented by CTCF binding within
              the H19 ICR. CTCF binding in the maternal ICR regulates its
              interaction with matrix attachment region (MAR)3 and DMR1 at
              Igf2, thus forming a tight loop around the maternal Igf2 locus,

              sites in the H19 ICR leads to loss of CTCF binding and de novo
              methylation of a CTCF target site within Igf2 DMR1, showing that

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite the important role DNA methylation plays in
              transcriptional regulation, the transgenerational inheritance of
              DNA methylation is not well understood. The genetic heritability
              of DNA methylation has been estimated using twin pairs, although
              concern has been expressed whether the underlying assumption of
              equal common environmental effects are applicable due to
              intrauterine differences between monozygotic and dizygotic twins.
              We estimate the heritability of DNA methylation on peripheral
              blood leukocytes using Illumina HumanMethylation450 array using a
              family based sample of 614 people from 117 families, allowing
              comparison both within and across generations. RESULTS: The
              correlations from the various available relative pairs indicate
              that on average the similarity in DNA methylation between
              relatives is predominantly due to genetic effects with any common
              environmental or zygotic effects being limited. The average
              heritability of DNA methylation measured at probes with no known
              SNPs is estimated as 0.187. The ten most heritable methylation
              probes were investigated with a genome-wide association study,
              all showing highly statistically significant cis mQTLs. Further
              investigation of one of these cis mQTL, found in the MHC region
              of chromosome 6, showed the most significantly associated SNP was
              also associated with over 200 other DNA methylation probes in
              this region and the gene expression level of 9 genes.
              CONCLUSIONS: The majority of transgenerational similarity in DNA
              methylation is attributable to genetic effects, and approximately
              20\% of individual differences in DNA methylation in the
