## DNA methylation analysis overview

Cytosine methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) is one of the main covalent base modifications in eukaryotic genomes, generally observed on CpG dinucleotides. The non-CpG methylation has been mainly observed in human embryonic stem and neuronal cells (Lister et al., 2009) (Lister et al., 2013). DNA methylation is a part of the epigenetic regulation mechanism of gene expression. It is cell-type specific DNA modification. It is reversible but mostly remains stable through cell division.  There are roughly 28 million CpGs in the human genome, 60â€“80% are generally methylated. Less than 10% of CpGs occur in CG-dense regions that are termed CpG islands in the human genome (Smith and Meissner, 2013). It has been demonstrated that DNA methylation is also not uniformly distributed over the genome, but rather is associated with CpG density. In vertebrate genomes, cytosine bases are usually unmethylated in CpG-rich regions such as CpG islands and tend to be methylated in CpG-deficient regions. Vertebrate genomes are largely CpG deficient except at CpG islands. Conversely, invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans do not exhibit cytosine methylation and consequently do not have CpG rich and poor regions but rather a steady CpG frequency over the genome (Deaton and Bird, 2011). 

DNA methylation is established by DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3 B in combination with DNMT3L and maintained through/after cell division by the methyltransferase DNMT1 and associated proteins. DNMT3a and DNMT3b are in charge of the de novo methylation during early development. Loss of 5mC can be achieved passively by dilution during replication or exclusion of DNMT1 from the nucleus. Recent discoveries of ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of proteins and their ability to convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in vertebrates provide a path for catalysed active DNA demethylation (Tahiliani et al., 2009). Iterative oxidations of 5hmC catalysed by TET result in 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 5caC mark is excised from DNA by G/T mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), which as a result returns cytosine residue back to its unmodified state (He et al., 2011). Apart from these, mainly bacteria but possibly higher eukaryotes contain base modifications on bases other than cytosine, such as methylated adenine or guanine (Clark et al., 2011).

One of the most reliable and popular ways to measure DNA methylation is high-throughput bisulfite sequencing. This method, and related ones, allow measurement of DNA methylation at the single nucleotide resolution. The bisulfite conversions turns unmethylated Cs to Ts and methylated Cs remain intact. Then, the only thing to do is to align the reads with those C->T conversions and count C->T mutations to calculate fraction of methylated bases. In the end, we can get quantitative genome-wide measurements for DNA methylation. For the remainder of this chapter, we will show how to do DNA methylation analysis using R. The analysis process can be chunked to four main parts with further sub-chunks:

1. Processing raw data
  - Quality check
  - Alignment and post-alingment processing
  - Methylation calling
  - Filtering bases
2. Exploratory analysis
  - Clustering
  - PCA
3. Defining regions of interest (ROI)
  - Differential methylation
  - Methylation segmentation 
4. Annotating ROI
  - Nearest genes
  - Annotation with other genomic features
  - Integration with other quantitative genomics data

## Processing raw data and getting data into R
The rawest form of data that most users get is probably in the form of 
fastq files obtained from the sequencing experiments. We will describe necessary steps and the tools that can be used for raw data processing and if exists we will mention their R equivalents. However, the data processing is usually done outside of the R 
framework and for the following sections we will assume that the data processing is done and our analysis is starting from methylation call files.

Typical data processing step starts with data quality check. The fastq files are first ran through a quality check software that shows the quality of the sequencing run. We would typically use [fastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) for this. However, there are several bioconductor packages that could be of use, such as [Rqc](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rqc.html) and [QuasR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QuasR.html). Following the quality check, provided everything is OK, the reads can be aligned to the genome. Before the alignment adapters or low quality ends of reads can be trimmed to increase number of alignments. Low quality ends mostly likely have poor basecalls which will lead to many mismatches. Reads with non-trimmed adapters will also not align to the genome. We would use adapter trimming tools such as [cutadapt]() or [flexbar]() for this purpose, although there are a bunch of them to be chosen from. Following this, reads are aligned to the genome with a bisulfite treatment aware aligner. For our own purposes, we use [Bismark](), however there are other equally accurate aligners, some are reviewed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3378906/). In addition, Bioconductor package [QuasR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QuasR.html) can align BS-seq reads within the R framework.

After alignment, we need to call C->T conversions and calculate fraction/percentage of methylation. Most of the time aligners come with auxilary tools that calculate per base methylation values. Normally, they output a tabular format containing the location of the Cs and methylation value and strand. Within R, [QuasR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QuasR.html) and [methylKit](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/methylKit.html) can call methylation values from BAM files albeit with some limitations. In essensence, these methylation call files can be easily read into R and downstream analysis within R starts from that point. An important quality measure at this stage is to look at conversion rate. This simply means how many unmethylated Cs are converted to Ts. Since we expect, non-CpG methylation to be rare. We can simply count number of C->T conversions in non-CpG context and calculate conversion rate. The best way to do this would be via spike-in sequences where we expect no methylation at all. Since, non-CpG methylation is tissue specific, calculating conversion rate using non-CpG Cs might be misleading in some cases.

## Data filtering and exploratory analysis
We assume that we start the analysis in R with the methylation call files. We will read those files in and carry out explaratory analysis, we will show how to filter bases or regions from the data and in what circumstances we might need to do so. We will use [methylKit](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/methylKit.html) package for the bulk of the analysis. 

### Reading methylation call files
A typical methylation call file looks like this:

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
tab <- read.table( system.file("extdata", "test1.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit"),header=TRUE,nrows=5)
tab
#knitr::kable(tab)
```


Most of the time bisulfite sequencing experiments have test and control  samples. The test samples can be from a disease tissue while the control  samples can be from a healthy tissue. You can read a set of methylation call files that have test/control conditions giving `treatment` vector option. For sake of subsequent analysis, file.list, sample.id and treatment option should have the same order. In the following example, first two files have the sample ids "test1" and "test2" and as determined by treatment vector they belong to the same group. The third and fourth files have sample ids "ctrl1" and "ctrl2" and they belong to the same group as indicated by the treatment vector. We will first get a list of file paths and have a look at the content.


```{r,message=FALSE}
library(methylKit)
file.list=list( system.file("extdata", 
                            "test1.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit"),
                system.file("extdata",
                            "test2.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit"),
                system.file("extdata", 
                            "control1.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit"),
                system.file("extdata", 
                            "control2.myCpG.txt", package = "methylKit") )

file.list
```

As you can see `file.list` variable is a simple list of file paths. Each file contains methylation calls for a given sample. Now, we can read the files with `methRead()` function.
```{r read files}
# read the files to a methylRawList object: myobj
myobj=methRead(file.list,
           sample.id=list("test1","test2","ctrl1","ctrl2"),
           assembly="hg18",
           treatment=c(1,1,0,0),
           context="CpG"
           )
```

tab-seperated bedgraph like formats from Bismark methylation caller can also be read in by methylkit. In those cases, we have to provide either `pipeline="bismarkCoverage"`  or `pipeline="bismarkCytosineReport"` to `methRead` function. In addition to the options we mentioned above,
any tab separated text file with a generic format can be read in using methylKit, 
such as methylation ratio files from [BSMAP](http://code.google.com/p/bsmap/).
See [here](http://zvfak.blogspot.com/2012/10/how-to-read-bsmap-methylation-ratio.html) for an example.

Before, we move on let us have a look at what kind of information is stored in `myobj`. This is technically a `methylRawList` object, which is essentially a list of `methylRaw` objects. These objects hold
the information for location of Cs, and methylated Cs and unmethylated Cs.
```{r}
## inside the methylRawList object
length(myobj)
head(myobj[[1]])
```

### Further quality check
It is always a good idea to check how the data looks like before proceeding further. For example, the methylation values should have bimodal distribution generally. This can be checked via 
`getMethylationStats` function. Normally, we should see a bimodal
distributions. Strong deviations from the bimodality may be due poor experimental quality, such as problems with bisulfite treatment.
```{r methStats}
getMethylationStats(myobj[[2]],plot=TRUE,both.strands=FALSE)
```

In addition, we might want to see coverage values. By default, methylkit handles bases with at least 10X coverage by that can be changed. The bases with unsually high coverage is usually alarming. It might indicate a PCR bias issue in the experimental procedure. The general coverage statistics can be checked with 
`getCoverageStats` function. 

```{r coverageStats}
getCoverageStats(myobj[[2]],plot=TRUE,both.strands=FALSE)

```

It might be useful to filter samples based on coverage. Particularly, if our samples are suffering from PCR bias it would be useful to discard bases with very high read coverage. Furthermore, we would also like to discard bases that have low read coverage, a high enough read coverage will increase the power of the statistical tests. The code below filters a `methylRawList` and discards bases that have coverage below 10X and also discards the bases that have more than 99.9th percentile of coverage in each sample.

```{r }
filtered.myobj=filterByCoverage(myobj,lo.count=10,lo.perc=NULL,
                                      hi.count=NULL,hi.perc=99.9)
```


### Merging samples into a single table
When we first read the files, each file is stored as its own entity. If we want compare samples in any way, we need to make a unified data structure that contains CpGs that are covered in most samples. The `unite` function creates a new object using the CpGs covered in each sample. This means 
```{r}
meth=unite(myobj, destrand=FALSE)
```

Let us take a look at the data content of methylBase object:

```{r}
head(meth)
```

By default, `unite` function produces bases/regions covered in all samples. That requirement can be relaxed using "min.per.group" option in `unite` function.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# creates a methylBase object, 
# where only CpGs covered with at least 1 sample per group will be returned

# there were two groups defined by the treatment vector, 
# given during the creation of myobj: treatment=c(1,1,0,0)
meth.min=unite(myobj,min.per.group=1L)
```

### Filtering CpGs
We might need to filter the CpGs further before explaratory analysis or even befor the downstream analysis such as differential methylation . For explaratory analysis, it is of general interest to see how samples relate to each other and we might want to remove CpGs that are not variable before doing that. Or we might remove Cs that are potentially C->T mutations. First, we show how to
filter based on variation.
```{r methVar}
pm=percMethylation(meth) # get percent methylation matrix
mds=matrixStats::rowVars(pm) # calculate standard deviation CpGs
head(meth[mds>20,])
```

Now, let's assume we know the locations of C->T mutations. These locations should be removed from the analysis as they do not represent
bisulfite treatment associated conversions. Mutation locations are 
stored in a `GRanges` object, and we can use that to remove CpGs 
overlapping with mutations.
```{r snps}
library(GenomicRanges)
mut=GRanges(seqnames=c("chr21","chr21"),
            ranges=IRanges(start=c(9853296, 9853326),
                           end=c( 9853296,9853326)))

# select CpGs that do not overlap with mutations
sub.meth=meth[! as(meth,"GRanges") %over% mut,]
nrow(meth)
nrow(sub.meth)
```

### Clustering samples
Clustering is used for grouping data points by their similarity. It is a general concept that can be achieved by many different algorithms. In the context of DNA methylation we are trying to find samples that are similar to eachother. For example, if we sequenced three heart samples and 4 liver samples, we would expect liver samples will be more similar to eachother than heart samples on the DNA methylation space. 

The following function will cluster the samples and draw a dendrogram.
It will use correlation distance which is $1-\rho$ , where $\rho$ is the correlation coefficient between two pairs of samples. The cluster tree will be drawn using the "ward" method. This specific variant uses a "bottom up" approach: each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy. In Ward's method, two clusters are merged if the variance is minimized compared to other possible merges. 
```{r}
clusterSamples(meth, dist="correlation", method="ward", plot=TRUE)
```

Setting the `plot=FALSE` will return a dendrogram object which can be manipulated by users or fed in to other user functions that can work with dendrograms.

```{r,message=FALSE}
hc = clusterSamples(meth, dist="correlation", method="ward", plot=FALSE)
```

### Principal component analysis 
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical transformation of possibly(correlated) variables into a number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The resulting components from this transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the highest variance and accounts for as most of the variability in the data. The following function will plot a scree plot for importance of components.

```{r}
PCASamples(meth, screeplot=TRUE)
```

We can also plot PC1 and PC2 axis and a scatter plot of our samples on those axis which will reveal how they cluster within these new dimensions. Similar to clustering dendrogram, we would like to see samples that are similar to be close to each other on the scatter plot. If they are not, it might indicate problems with the experiment such as batch effects.

```{r}
pc=PCASamples(meth,obj.return = TRUE, adj.lim=c(1,1))
```

In this case, we also returned an object from the plotting function. this is the output of R `prcomp` function, which includes loadings and eigen vectors which might be useful. You can also do your own PCA analysis using `percMethylation` and `prcomp`. In the case above, the methylation matrix is transponsed. This allows us to compare distances between samples on the PCA scatterplot. 

## Defining regions of interest
When analyzing DNA methylation data, we usually look for regions that are different than the rest of the methylome or different from a reference methylome. These regions are so called "regions of interest". 
They usually mark important genomic features that are related to gene regulation which in turn defines the cell type. Therefore, it is a general interest to find such regions and analyze them further to understand our biological sample or to answer specific research questions.


### Differential methylation
Once methylation proportions per base are obtained, generally, the dynamics of methylation profiles are considered next. When there are multiple sample groups, it is usually of interest to locate bases or regions with different methylation proportions across samples. The bases or regions with different methylation proportions across samples are called differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). They have been shown to play a role in many different diseases due to their association with epigenetic control of gene regulation. In addition, DNA methylation profiles can be highly tissue-specific due to their role in gene regulation (SchÃ¼beler, 2015). DNA methylation is highly informative when studying normal and diseased cells, because it can also act as a biomarker (SchÃ¼beler, 2015). For example, the presence of large-scale abnormally methylated genomic regions is a hallmark feature of many types of cancers (Ehrlich, 2002). Because of aforementioned reasons, investigating differential methylation is usually one of the primary goals of doing bisulfite sequencing.

### Methylation segmentation
The analysis of methylation dynamics is not exclusively restricted to differentially methylated regions across samples, apart from this there is also an interest in examining the methylation profiles within the same sample. Usually, depressions in methylation profiles pinpoint regulatory regions like gene promoters that co-localize with CG-dense CpG islands. On the other hand, many gene-body regions are extensively methylated and CpG-poor (Bock et al., 2012). These observations would describe a bimodal model of either hyper- or hypomethylated regions dependent on the local density of CpGs (LÃ¶vkvist et al., 2016). However, given the detection of CpG-poor regions with locally reduced levels of methylation (on average 30%) in pluripotent embryonic stem cells and in neuronal progenitors in both mouse and human, a different model seems also reasonable (Stadler et al., 2011). These low-methylated regions (LMRs) are located distal to promoters, have little overlap with CpG islands and associated with enhancer marks such as p300 binding sites and H3K27ac enrichment.


## Annotation of ROI
The regions of interest obtained through differential methylation or segmentation analysis often need to be integrated with genome annotation datasets. Without this type of integration, differential methylation or segmentation results will be hard to interpret in biological terms. The most common annotation task is to see where regions of interest land in relation to genes and gene parts and regulatory regions: Do they mostly occupy promoter, intronic or exonic regions? Do they overlap with repeats? Do they overlap with other epigenomic markers or long-range regulatory regions? These questions are not specific to methylation âˆ’nearly all regions of interest obtained via genome-wide studies have to deal with such questions. Thus, there are already multiple software tools that can produce such annotations. One is the Bioconductor package genomation (Akalin et al., 2015). It can be used to annotate DMRs/DMCs and it can also be used to integrate methylation proportions over the genome with other quantitative information and produce meta-gene plots or heatmaps. Another similar package is ChIPpeakAnno (Zhu et al., 2010), which is designed for ChIP-seq peak annotation but could also be used for DMR/DMC annotation to a certain degree.
- find nearest genes
- integrate with other quantitative data sets
- annotate with other genomic features promoter/exon/intron/enhancers
